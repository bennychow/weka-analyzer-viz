# Weka Analyzer Visualizations #

What are the Weka Analyzer Visualizations?

Includes three easy to use Analyzer visualizations that allow you to run machine learning algorithms in Weka.  The following algorithms are included:

* Decision Tree - Use this classification algorithm to find rules that predict an outcome.
* Clustering - Find similiar groups of instances and optionally test against a desired outcome.
* Attribute Selection - Identify which attributes are most predictive for an outcome.

This plugin adds visualizations to Analyzer and requires Pentaho Enterprise Edition 6.1+  

You can install this plugin using the Pentaho Marketplace.
